# Case Study 5 - Data MartðŸ›’
Data Mart is an online supermarket that specialises in fresh produce. In June 2020 - large scale supply changes were made at Data Mart. All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in every single step from the farm all the way to the customer.

The key business question to be answered are the following:
-  What was the quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020?
-  Which platform, region, segment and customer types were the most impacted by this change?
-  What can we do about future introduction of similar sustainability updates to the business to minimise impact on sales?

# Task
For this task we will have to analyse the sales performance and also quantify the impact of sustainable packaging on the sales performance for Data Mart and itâ€™s separate business areas.

For this case study there is only one table `data_mart.weekly_sales`. The columns in the table are defined as follows:
-  Data Mart has international operations using a multi-`region` strategy
-  Data Mart has both, a retail and online `platform` in the form of a Shopify store front to serve their customers
-  Customer `segment` and `customer_type` data relates to personal age and demographics information that is shared with Data Mart
-  `transactions` is the count of unique purchases made through Data Mart and `sales` is the actual dollar amount of purchases
Each record in the dataset is related to a specific aggregated slice of the underlying sales data rolled up into a `week_date` value which represents the start of the sales week.

# Case Study Questions with Solutions

## 1. Data Cleansing Steps
In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the `data_mart` schema named `clean_weekly_sales`:
-  Convert the `week_date` to a `DATE` format
-  Add a `week_numbe`r as the second column for each `week_date` value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
-  Add a `month_number` with the calendar month for each `week_date` value as the 3rd column
-  Add a `calendar_year` 
olumn as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
-  Add a new column called `age_band` after the original `segment` column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value

-  Add a new `demographic` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the `segment`` values:

-  Ensure all `null` string values with an `unknown` string value in the original `segment` column as well as the new `age_band` and `demographic` columns
-  Generate a new `avg_transaction` column as the `sales` value divided by `transactions` rounded to 2 decimal places for each record
