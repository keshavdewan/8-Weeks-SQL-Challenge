# Case Study 5 - Data MartðŸ›’
Data Mart is an online supermarket that specialises in fresh produce. In June 2020 - large scale supply changes were made at Data Mart. All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in every single step from the farm all the way to the customer.

The key business question to be answered are the following:
-  What was the quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020?
-  Which platform, region, segment and customer types were the most impacted by this change?
-  What can we do about future introduction of similar sustainability updates to the business to minimise impact on sales?

# Task
For this task we will have to analyse the sales performance and also quantify the impact of sustainable packaging on the sales performance for Data Mart and itâ€™s separate business areas.

For this case study there is only one table `data_mart.weekly_sales`. The columns in the table are defined as follows:
-  Data Mart has international operations using a multi-`region` strategy
-  Data Mart has both, a retail and online `platform` in the form of a Shopify store front to serve their customers
-  Customer `segment` and `customer_type` data relates to personal age and demographics information that is shared with Data Mart
-  `transactions` is the count of unique purchases made through Data Mart and `sales` is the actual dollar amount of purchases
Each record in the dataset is related to a specific aggregated slice of the underlying sales data rolled up into a `week_date` value which represents the start of the sales week.
### Example Table `data_mart.weekly_sales`

# Case Study Questions with Solutions

## A. Data Cleansing Steps
In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the `data_mart` schema named `clean_weekly_sales`:
-  Convert the `week_date` to a `DATE` format
-  Add a `week_numbe`r as the second column for each `week_date` value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
-  Add a `month_number` with the calendar month for each `week_date` value as the 3rd column
-  Add a `calendar_year` 
olumn as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
-  Add a new column called `age_band` after the original `segment` column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value
<img src = "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95aaef7f-d059-4739-a131-00284f03b30c" alt = "Image" width = "280" height = "220">

-  Add a new `demographic` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the `segment`` values:
<img src = "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38c7377d-d5f7-45d0-9e38-c9435dd1c6de" alt = "Image" width = "150" height = "150">

-  Ensure all `null` string values with an `unknown` string value in the original `segment` column as well as the new `age_band` and `demographic` columns
-  Generate a new `avg_transaction` column as the `sales` value divided by `transactions` rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

### New Table 'clean_weekly_sales`:
````sql
CREATE TABLE data_mart.clean_weekly_sales AS
	SELECT TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD/MM/YY') AS week_date,
			EXTRACT(WEEK FROM TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD/MM/YY')) AS week_number,
			EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD/MM/YY')) AS month_number,
			EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD/MM/YY')) AS calendar_year,
			region,
			platform,
			segment,
			CASE 
				WHEN RIGHT(segment,1) = '1' THEN 'Young Adults'
				WHEN RIGHT(segment,1) = '2' THEN 'Middle Aged'
				WHEN RIGHT(segment,1) IN ('3', '4') THEN 'Retirees'
				ELSE 'Unknown'
			END AS age_band,
			CASE 
				WHEN LEFT(segment,1) = 'C' THEN 'Couples'
				WHEN LEFT(segment,1) = 'F' THEN 'Families'
				ELSE 'Unknown'
			END AS demographic,
			transactions,
			sales,
			ROUND((sales::numeric/transactions),2) AS avg_transaction
FROM data_mart.weekly_sales
GROUP BY
    week_date,
    week_number,
    month_number,
    calendar_year,
    region,
    platform,
    segment,
    age_band,
    demographic,
    transactions,
    sales

## B. Data Exploration

### 1. What day of the week is used for each week_date value?
_Approach Taken_
-	Use `DISTINCT` and `TO_CHAR` functios to get the day of the week

````sql
SELECT DISTINCT(TO_CHAR(week_date, 'day')) AS week_day 
FROM clean_weekly_sales
````

### 2.What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?
_Approach Taken_
-	CTE 'week_number_cte`, use `GENERATE_SERIES` function to generate `week_number` from 1 to 52
-	`LEFT JOIN` the CTE with `clean_weekly_sales` table to get the missing numbers

````sql
WITH week_number_cte AS (
		SELECT GENERATE_SERIES(1,52) AS week_number
		)
SELECT DISTINCT wn.week_number
FROM week_number_cte wn
LEFT JOIN clean_weekly_sales cws ON wn.week_number = cws.week_number
WHERE cws.week_number IS NULL
````

### 3. How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?
_Approach Taken_
-	Use `SUM` to calculate the toal transactions and `GROUP BY` for grouping them with the years

````sql
SELECT calendar_year,
	SUM(transactions) AS total_transactions
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY calendar_year
ORDER BY calendar_year
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f02bb78-5e7e-43d2-994c-cd731905349a)

### 4. What is the total sales for each region for each month?
_Approach Taken_
-	use of `SUM` function for sales and `GROUP BY` & `ORDER BY`  

````sql
SELECT region,
		month_number,
		SUM(sales)
FROM data_mart.clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY region, month_number
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/355a3479-2e95-4831-b4a6-6d7938e63ad2)

### 5. What is the total count of transactions for each platform
_Approach Taken_
-	use of `SUM` for transactions

````sql
SELECT 	platform,
	SUM(transactions) AS total_transactions
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY platform
````
_sample rows_

### 6. What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?
_Approach Taken_
-	CTE 'monthlysales`, calculates the total sales for each platform ('Retail' and 'Shopify') for each month
-	CTE `totalmonthlysales`, calculates the total sales for each month, regardless of the platform.
-	Final `SELECT` statement joins the two CTEs and calculates the percentage of sales for each platform in each month by dividing the platform-specific sales by the total monthly sales

````sql
WITH monthlysales AS(
		SELECT month_number,
				platform,
				SUM(sales) AS monthly_sales
		FROM clean_weekly_sales
		GROUP BY month_number, platform
),
totalmonthlysales AS (
		SELECT month_number,
				SUM(sales) AS total_sales
		FROM clean_weekly_sales
		GROUP BY month_number
)
SELECT ms.month_number,
		ms.platform,
		ROUND((ms.monthly_sales * 100.0) / tms.total_sales,2) AS percent_sales
FROM monthlysales ms
JOIN totalmonthlysales tms ON ms.month_number = tms.month_number
ORDER BY ms.month_number, ms.platform
````

### 7. What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?
_Approach Taken_
-	This query follows similar approach to what we did in the previous query
-	This time we just replaced `month_number` with `calendar_year` and `platform` with `demographic`

````sql
WITH yearlysales AS(
		SELECT calendar_year,
				demographic,
				SUM(sales) AS yearly_sales
		FROM clean_weekly_sales
		GROUP BY calendar_year, demographic
),
totalyearlysales AS (
		SELECT calendar_year,
				SUM(sales) AS total_sales
		FROM clean_weekly_sales
		GROUP BY calendar_year
)
SELECT ys.calendar_year,
		ys.demographic,
		ROUND((ys.yearly_sales * 100.0) / tys.total_sales,2) AS percent_sales
FROM yearlysales ys
JOIN totalyearlysales tys ON ys.calendar_year = tys.calendar_year
ORDER BY ys.calendar_year, ys.demographic
````

### 8. Which age_band and demographic values contribute the most to Retail sales?
_Approach Taken_
-	used `SUM` of sales and filtered it with `WHERE` clause for getting the `age_band` and `demographic` with max retail sales

````sql
SELECT age_band,
	demographic,
	SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE platform = 'Retail'
GROUP BY age_band, demographic
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 1
````

### 9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?
_Approach Taken_
-	calculated `avg_transaction_row` and `avg_transaction_group`
-	`avg_transaction_row` calculates the average transaction size by dividing the sales of each row by the number of transactions in that row.
-	On the other hand, avg_transaction_group calculates the average transaction size by dividing the total sales for the entire dataset by the total number of transactions.
For finding the average transaction size for each year by platform accurately, it is recommended to use `avg_transaction_group`

*copied solution

````sql
SELECT calendar_year,
		platform,
		ROUND(AVG(avg_transaction),0) AS avg_transaction_row,
		ROUND(SUM(sales)/SUM(transactions),0) AS avg_transaction_group
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY calendar_year,
	platform
ORDER BY calendar_year
````
