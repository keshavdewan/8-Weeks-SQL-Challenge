# Entity Relation Diagram
Data can be taken from [dbfiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/jmnwogTsUE8hGqkZv9H7E8/17)

The database consists of 5 Tables:
1. `users` - Customers who visit the Clique Bait website are tagged via their `cookie_id`

2. `events` - Customer visits are logged in this events table at a `cookie_id` level and the `event_type` and `page_id` values can be used to join onto relevant satellite tables to obtain further information about each event. The `sequence_number` is used to order the events within each visit.

# Case Study Questions with Solutions
## A. Digital Analysis

### 1. How many users are there?
_Approach Taken_
-    used `COUNT(DISTINCT)` function for calculating the numbers from `user_id`

````sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
FROM clique_bait.users
````

### 2. How many cookies does each user have on average?
_Approach Taken_
-  CTE `cookie_count` counts the number of cookies for each user
-  Final `SELECT` statement calculates the average of this count

````sql
WITH cookie_count AS(
		SELECT user_id,
				COUNT(cookie_id) AS cookie_id_count
		FROM clique_bait.users
		GROUP BY user_id
		)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(cookie_id_count),0) AS avg_user_cookies
FROM cookie_count
````

### 3. What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?
_Approach Taken_
-    Used `EXTRACT` to get the months and `DISTINCT` to count the visits

````sql
SELECT 	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_time) AS month,
		COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) AS unique_visits 
FROM clique_bait.events
GROUP BY month
````

### 4. What is the number of events for each event type?
