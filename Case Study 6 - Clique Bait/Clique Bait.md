# Entity Relation Diagram
Data can be taken from [dbfiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/jmnwogTsUE8hGqkZv9H7E8/17)

The database consists of 5 Tables:
1. `users` - Customers who visit the Clique Bait website are tagged via their `cookie_id`
<img width="366" alt="134623074-7c51d63a-c0a4-41e0-a6fc-257e4ca3997d" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e654e7a-d962-48f9-aaab-a50322de28df" />

2. `events` - Customer visits are logged in this events table at a `cookie_id` level and the `event_type` and `page_id` values can be used to join onto relevant satellite tables to obtain further information about each event. The `sequence_number` is used to order the events within each visit.

3. `event identifier` - The `event_identifier` table shows the types of events which are captured by Clique Baitâ€™s digital data systems.

4. `campaign identifier` - This table shows information for the 3 campaigns that Clique Bait has ran on their website so far in 2020.

5. `page hierarchy` - This table lists all of the pages on the Clique Bait website which are tagged and have data passing through from user interaction events.

# Case Study Questions with Solutions
## A. Digital Analysis

### 1. How many users are there?
_Approach Taken_
-    used `COUNT(DISTINCT)` function for calculating the numbers from `user_id`

````sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
FROM clique_bait.users
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/442829ec-aaa4-40e1-8584-d0b37893008b)

### 2. How many cookies does each user have on average?
_Approach Taken_
-  CTE `cookie_count` counts the number of cookies for each user
-  Final `SELECT` statement calculates the average of this count

````sql
WITH cookie_count AS(
		SELECT user_id,
				COUNT(cookie_id) AS cookie_id_count
		FROM clique_bait.users
		GROUP BY user_id
		)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(cookie_id_count),0) AS avg_user_cookies
FROM cookie_count
````

### 3. What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?
_Approach Taken_
-    Used `EXTRACT` to get the months and `DISTINCT` to count the visits

````sql
SELECT 	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_time) AS month,
		COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) AS unique_visits 
FROM clique_bait.events
GROUP BY month
````

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e80d727f-71ed-4132-ba46-6d26c0da9402)

### 4. What is the number of events for each event type?
_Approach Taken_
-    used `COUNT` of `event_type` for the number of events here

````sql
SELECT 	event_type,
	COUNT(event_type) AS event_count 
FROM clique_bait.events
GROUP BY event_type
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30720b8d-e1f1-4dd0-a7a5-325aa7b7b34f)

### 5. What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?
_Approach Taken_
-    CTE 'purchasevisits` calcualtes the distinct `visit_id` from `events` table having event as `purchase`
-    CTE `totalvisits` calculates the total count of distinct visits
-    Final `SELECT` statement counts the purchase visits giving the number of visits with purchase and divides with total visits to get the percentage

````sql
WITH purchasevisits AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT e.visit_id
    FROM clique_bait.events AS e
    JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier AS ei ON e.event_type = ei.event_type
    WHERE ei.event_name = 'Purchase'
),
totalvisits AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) as total_visits 
    FROM clique_bait.events
)
SELECT 
    ROUND((100.0 * COUNT(pv.visit_id) / tv.total_visits),2) AS percentage_purchase
FROM purchasevisits pv, totalvisits tv
GROUP BY tv.total_visits
````

### 6. What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?
_Approach Taken_
-	CTE `checkout_purchase` covers two `CASE` statements, when `event_type` is `1` (page view) and `page_id = `12` (checkout) as checkout and 
									`event_type` is `3` (purchase) as purchase then it would give the `MAX` score
-	Final `SELECT` statement calculates the percentage of `purchase` to `checkout`

````sql
WITH checkout_purchase AS (
SELECT 
  visit_id,
  MAX(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 AND page_id = 12 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS checkout,
  MAX(CASE WHEN event_type = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase
FROM clique_bait.events
GROUP BY visit_id)

SELECT 
  ROUND(100 * (1-(SUM(purchase)::numeric/SUM(checkout))),2) AS percentage_checkout_view_with_no_purchase
FROM checkout_purchase
````

### 7. What are the top 3 pages by number of views?
_Approach Taken_
-	CTE `top_page` counts the top pages visited
-	Final `SELECT` statement adds the `page_name` to them

````sql
WITH top_page AS(
		SELECT 	page_id,
		COUNT(event_type) AS page_views
		FROM clique_bait.events
		WHERE event_type = 1
		GROUP BY page_id
		ORDER BY page_views
		)
SELECT tp.page_id,
		ph.page_name,
		tp.page_views
FROM top_page tp
JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy ph ON tp.page_id = ph.page_id
GROUP BY tp.page_id,
		ph.page_name,
		tp.page_views
ORDER BY tp.page_views DESC
LIMIT 3
````

### 8. What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?
_Approach Taken_
-	Use `CASE` Statement to sum the number of instances when `event_type` is `page view` or `add to cart`

````sql
SELECT ph.product_category,
	SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_view,
	SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_add
FROM clique_bait.events e
JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy ph ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
WHERE ph.product_category IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ph.product_category
ORDER BY page_view DESC
