# Case Study 4‚Ää-‚ÄäData¬†Bank üèõÔ∏è

## Introduction
Danny has decided to get into the business of Neo-banks: new aged digital only banks without physical branches.
Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank‚Ää-‚Ääbut it isn't only for banking activities, they also have the world's most secure distributed data storage platform!
Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts.

## Task
There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help! 
-  Increasing their customer base: Like any new business, they want to attract more customers.
-  Forecasting data storage needs: They need to accurately predict how much storage their customers will need in the future to plan for their infrastructure needs.

This case study focuses on using data analysis to help Data Bank achieve these goals by calculating key metrics, analyzing growth, and making data-driven decisions.

### ERD Diagram
The Data Bank team have prepared a data model for this case study as well as a few example rows from the complete dataset below to get you familiar with their tables.

#### Entity Relationship Diagram

The Data Bank contains 3 tables:
-  `regions` : The regions table contains the `region_id` and their respective `region_name` values

#### Case Study Questions with Solutions

#### A. Customer Nodes Exploration

#### 1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?
_Approach Taken_
  - Using `COUNT(DISTINCT node_id)` to calculate the unique nodes in the system
  
````sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT node_id) AS unique_node
FROM customer_nodes
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a8afce8-1256-4b8e-a1a5-5dab0426bdd8)

#### 2. What is the number of nodes per region?
_Approach Taken_
  - Since we have been asked the number of nodes per region, we will join table `customer_nodes` with table `regions` ON `region_id` so as to have the `region_name` as well
    
````sql
SELECT 	r.region_id,
		r.region_name,
		COUNT(DISTINCT cn.node_id) AS nodes
FROM regions r
JOIN customer_nodes cn ON r.region_id = cn.region_id
GROUP BY r.region_id,
		r.region_name
````

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed9a5c69-61da-4b74-87a9-ce4d9c618824)

#### 3. How many customers are allocated to each region?
_Approach Taken_
  - This is similar to the previous query, we just had to replace the `node_id` with `customer_id` here

````sql
SELECT 	r.region_id,
		r.region_name,
		COUNT(DISTINCT cn.customer_id) AS cust_num
FROM regions r
JOIN customer_nodes cn ON r.region_id = cn.region_id
GROUP BY r.region_id,
		r.region_name
````

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caa722fe-86bc-4bf6-9401-9aaf5fb4f7a0)

#### 4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?
_Approach Taken_
  - We used here `AVG(end_date - start_date)
  - There is an abnormal date in the data - '9999-12-31', we have to filter it using the `WHERE` commands

````sql
SELECT 
	ROUND(AVG(end_date - start_date),0) AS avg_reallocation_days
FROM customer_nodes
WHERE end_date != '9999-12-31'
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bf4548c-5d4f-4fff-8a88-2801eac9e5ee)

*reallocation days* likely refers to the time a customer's data is hosted on a specific server or node within their system.  Calculating this duration helps Data Bank understand:
-  Customer churn: Shorter reallocation days might indicate customers are leaving or moving their data frequently. This could signal issues with service, pricing, or competition.
-  Resource optimization: Knowing how long data typically stays on a node helps Data Bank plan their infrastructure. They can allocate resources more efficiently, predict when they might need more storage in certain regions, and potentially even offer different service tiers based on data mobility.
-  Identifying patterns: Analyzing reallocation days in conjunction with other factors like region, customer demographics, or account balance could reveal trends and inform business decisions. For example, they might find that customers in certain regions tend to keep their data with them longer.
  
#### 5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?
_Approach Taken_
  - Use a CTE to find the difference between `start_date` and `end_date`
  - Use `PERCENTILE_CONT` and `WITHIN GROUP` to find the median, 80th, and 95th percentile

````sql
WITH date_diff AS(
	SELECT cn.customer_id,
			cn.region_id,
			r.region_name,
			(end_date - start_date) AS reallocation_days
	FROM customer_nodes cn
	JOIN regions r ON cn.region_id = r.region_id
	WHERE end_date != '9999-12-31'
)
SELECT DISTINCT region_id,
				region_name,
				PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY reallocation_days)
										OVER(PARTITION BY region_name) AS median,
				PERCENTILE_CONT(0.8) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY reallocation_days)
										OVER(PARTITION BY region_name) AS percentile_80,
				PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY reallocation_days)
										OVER(PARTITION BY region_name) AS percentile_95
FROM date_diff
ORDER BY region_name

### B. Customer Transactions

#### 1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?
_Approach Taken_
-	`COUNT(customer_id)` and also `SUM(txn_amount)` for this case

````sql
SELECT txn_type,
		COUNT(customer_id) AS transaction_count,
		SUM(txn_amount) AS total_amt
FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
GROUP BY txn_type
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b78c284-1f66-4f6f-a16a-4d2526386843)

#### 2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?
_Approach Taken_
-	count the customers and round them for their average

````sql
WITH deposit AS(
		SELECT customer_id,
				COUNT(customer_id) AS deposit_count,
				ROUND(AVG(txn_amount),0) AS avg_deposits
		FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
		WHERE txn_type = 'deposit'
		GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(deposit_count),0) AS avg_count,
		ROUND(AVG(avg_deposits),0) AS avg_deposit
FROM deposit
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22a3ed05-9d15-4480-b318-98060c684adf)

#### 3. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?
_Approach Taken_
-	CTE `monthly_transaction` creates `CASE` statement with `txn_type` as 'deposit', 'purchase' and 'withdrawl'
-	In the final SELECT statement we filter using `WHERE`  statement to get the customer numbers
  
````sql
WITH bank_customers AS(
		SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM txn_date) AS month,
				customer_id,
				SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS deposit_count,
				SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase_count,
				SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawl' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS withdrawl_count
		FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
		GROUP BY month,customer_id
)
SELECT month,
		COUNT(customer_id) AS cust_count
FROM bank_customers
WHERE deposit_count >= 1 AND
	(purchase_count >= 1 OR withdrawl_count >= 1)
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month
````

#### 4. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month? Also show the change in balance each month in the same table output.
_Approach Taken_
-	CTE `monthlychanges` calculates the `monthly_change` in balance for each customer every month
-	Final `SELECT` statement calculates the `SUM` of `closing_balance` partitioned by `customer_id` and ordered by `month`  

````sql
WITH monthlychanges AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM txn_date) AS month,
        SUM(CASE 
            WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount
            WHEN txn_type IN ('purchase', 'withdrawal') THEN -txn_amount
            ELSE 0 
            END) AS monthly_change
    FROM 
        data_bank.customer_transactions
    GROUP BY 
        customer_id, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM txn_date)
)
SELECT 
    mc.customer_id,
    mc.month,
    SUM(mc.monthly_change) OVER (PARTITION BY mc.customer_id ORDER BY mc.month) AS closing_balance,
    mc.monthly_change
FROM 
    monthlychanges mc
ORDER BY 
    mc.customer_id, mc.month
````

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2fe16de-20bb-4f65-8226-2f64b3d5eddb)

#### 5. What is the percentage of customers who increase their closing balance by more than 5%?
_Approach taken_
-	CTE `MonthlyChanges` calculates the monthly changes in balance
-	CTE `ClosingBalances` calculates the `closing_balance` for each month
-	CTE `LaggedBalances` calcultes the closing balance from previous month for each customer
-	Final statement counts how many customers had a significant increase in their balance and divide that by the total number of customers to get a percentage

````sql
WITH MonthlyChanges AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM txn_date) AS month,
        SUM(CASE 
            WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount
            WHEN txn_type IN ('purchase', 'withdrawal') THEN -txn_amount
            ELSE 0 
            END) AS monthly_change
    FROM 
        data_bank.customer_transactions
    GROUP BY 
        customer_id, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM txn_date)
), 
ClosingBalances AS (
  SELECT 
        mc.customer_id,
        mc.month,
        SUM(mc.monthly_change) OVER (PARTITION BY mc.customer_id ORDER BY mc.month) AS closing_balance
  FROM MonthlyChanges mc  
),
LaggedBalances AS 
  SELECT 
    cb.customer_id,
    cb.month,
    cb.closing_balance,
    LAG(cb.closing_balance) OVER (PARTITION BY cb.customer_id ORDER BY cb.month) AS previous_closing_balance
FROM ClosingBalances cb
)
SELECT 
    CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN closing_balance > previous_closing_balance * 1.05 THEN customer_id END) AS DECIMAL) * 100 / COUNT(customer_id) AS percentage
FROM 
    LaggedBalances
WHERE 
    previous_closing_balance IS NOT NULL

### C. Data Allocation Challenge

To test out a few different hypotheses - the Data Bank team wants to run an experiment where different groups of customers would be allocated data using 3 different options:

**Option 1**: data is allocated based off the amount of money at the end of the previous month
**Option 2**: data is allocated on the average amount of money kept in the account in the previous 30 days
**Option 3**: data is updated real-time

For this multi-part challenge question - you have been requested to generate the following data elements to help the Data Bank team estimate how much data will need to be provisioned for each option:

#### 1. Running customer balance column that includes the impact each transaction
_Approach Taken_
-	Use `CASE` statement to sum the `txn_type` i.e. deposit, withdrawal, purchase
-	Use `PARTITION BY` to calculate the `running_balance` that reflects the impace of each transaction on customer's balance

````sql
SELECT customer_id,
		txn_date,
		txn_type,
		txn_amount,
		SUM(CASE 
				WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount 
				WHEN txn_type IN ('withdrawal', 'purchase') THEN -txn_amount
				ELSE 0
			END) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS running_balance
FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
````

#### 2. Customer balance at the end of each month
_Approach Taken_
-	CTE `monthlybalance` calculates the `monthly_change` of balance for each customer
-	Final SELECT statement uses `SUM() OVER()` functionality to calculate the running total monthly for each customer and giving the balance at the end of every month

````sql
WITH monthlybalance AS(
		SELECT customer_id,
				EXTRACT(MONTH FROM txn_date) AS month,
						SUM(CASE 
							WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount 
							WHEN txn_type IN ('withdrawal', 'purchase') THEN -txn_amount
							ELSE 0
						END) AS monthly_change
		FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
		GROUP BY customer_id, month
		)
SELECT mb.customer_id,
		mb.month,
		SUM(mb.monthly_change) OVER (PARTITION BY mb.customer_id
										ORDER BY mb.month) AS closing_balance
FROM monthlybalance mb
ORDER BY mb.customer_id, mb.month
		
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab88d2b9-33d1-4d59-9062-344165f98e46)

#### 3. Minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer
_Approach Taken_
-	CTE `runningbalance` calculates the running balance every month
-	Final SELECT statement calculates the min, average and maximum values for the running balance 

````sql
WITH runningbalance AS(
		SELECT customer_id,
				txn_date,
				SUM(CASE 
						WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount 
						WHEN txn_type IN ('withdrawal', 'purchase') THEN -txn_amount
						ELSE 0
						END) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id
									ORDER BY txn_date) AS running_balance
		FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
		)
SELECT 	customer_id,
		MIN(running_balance) AS minimum_balance,
		AVG(running_balance) AS avg_balance,
		MAX(running_balance) AS max_balance
FROM runningbalance
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id
````

### D. Extra Challenge
Data Bank wants to try another option which is a bit more difficult to implement - they want to calculate data growth using an interest calculation, just like in a traditional savings account you might have with a bank.

If the annual interest rate is set at 6% and the Data Bank team wants to reward its customers by increasing their data allocation based off the interest calculated on a daily basis at the end of each day, how much data would be required for this option on a monthly basis?

_Special notes:_
Data Bank wants an initial calculation which does not allow for compounding interest, however they may also be interested in a daily compounding interest calculation so you can try to perform this calculation if you have the stamina!

_Approach Taken_
-	CTE `DailyBalances` Calculate the running balance for each customer for each day
-	CTE `DailyInterest`Calculate the daily interest for each customer
-	CTE `MonthlyInterest` Aggregate the daily interest to get the monthly interest for each customer
-	Final `SELECT` Statement Calculate the total data required for each customer for each month based on the monthly interest


````sql
WITH DailyBalances AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        txn_date,
        SUM(CASE 
            WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount
            WHEN txn_type IN ('purchase', 'withdrawal') THEN -txn_amount
            ELSE 0 
            END) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS running_balance
    FROM 
        data_bank.customer_transactions
),
DailyInterest AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        txn_date,
        running_balance,
        running_balance * (0.06 / 365) AS daily_interest  -- 6% annual interest divided by 365 days
    FROM 
        DailyBalances
),
MonthlyInterest AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,  -- Include customer_id here
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM txn_date) AS month,
        SUM(daily_interest) AS total_monthly_interest
    FROM 
        DailyInterest
    GROUP BY 
        customer_id, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM txn_date)  -- Group by customer_id as well
)
SELECT 
    customer_id,  -- Select customer_id
    month,
    SUM(total_monthly_interest) AS total_data_required
FROM 
    MonthlyInterest
GROUP BY 
    customer_id, month  -- Group by customer_id and month
ORDER BY 
    customer_id, month

### Learnings

#### 1. Percentile
-  `PERCENTILE_CONT()` is a function that calculates percentiles.
-  `WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY reallocation_days)` specifies the data to use and how to order it.
-  `OVER (PARTITION BY region_name)` calculates percentiles separately for each region.
-  `LAG` allows you to access data from a previous row in the same result set. It's like having a peek at the row "above" the current one.
	-  	`LAG(expression, offset, default_value) OVER (PARTITION BY partition_expression ORDER BY order_expression)`
	 	-  	`expression`: The column or expression you want to get the value from the previous row.
		-	`offset`: (Optional) How many rows back you want to look. The default is 1 (the immediate previous row).
		-	`default_value`: (Optional) The value to return if there is no previous row (e.g., for the first row in the partition).
		-	`PARTITION BY partition_expression`: (Optional) Divides the result set into groups (partitions) and applies the LAG() function separately within each partition.
		-	`ORDER BY order_expression`: Specifies how the rows are ordered within each partition to determine which row is "previous."

-	`SUM() OVER()` for Running Totals: The `SUM() OVER()` window function is specifically designed for calculating running totals. It adds up the values in a specified column as it moves through the rows, effectively giving you the running balance at each point.
