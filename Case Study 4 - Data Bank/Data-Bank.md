# Case Study 4 - Data Bank

## Introduction
Danny has decided to get into the business of Neo-banks: new aged digital only banks without physical branches.
Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn't only for banking activities, they also have the world's most secure distributed data storage platform!
Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts.

## Task
There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help! 
-  Increasing their customer base: Like any new business, they want to attract more customers.
-  Forecasting data storage needs: They need to accurately predict how much storage their customers will need in the future to plan for their infrastructure needs.

This case study focuses on using data analysis to help Data Bank achieve these goals by calculating key metrics, analyzing growth, and making data-driven decisions.
