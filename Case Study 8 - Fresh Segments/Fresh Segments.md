# Case Study 8 - Fresh Segments üçä 
Danny created Fresh Segments, a digital marketing agency that helps other businesses analyse trends in online ad click behaviour for their unique customer base.

Clients share their customer lists with the Fresh Segments team who then aggregate interest metrics and generate a single dataset worth of metrics for further analysis.

In particular - the composition and rankings for different interests are provided for each client showing the proportion of their customer list who interacted with online assets related to each interest for each month.

## Entity Relationship Diagram
Data can be extracted from [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/iRdsT76vaus813crPP8Ma4/10)

-  `interest_metrics`
    -  Each record in this table represents the performance of a specific `interest_id` based on the client‚Äôs customer base interest measured through clicks and interactions with specific targeted advertising content.
    -  the `composition` metric means that "x%" of the client‚Äôs customer list interacted with the interest interest_id "y" - we can link  `interest_id` to a separate mapping table to find the segment name called ‚ÄúVacation Rental Accommodation Researchers‚Äù
    -  The `index_value` is "z", means that the composition value is "Xtimes" the average composition value for all Fresh Segments clients‚Äô customer for this particular interest in that particular month
    -  The `ranking` and `percentage_ranking` relates to the order of `index_value` records in each month year.

-  `interest_map`
    -  This mapping table links the `interest_id` with their relevant interest information. We will need to join this table onto the previous `interest_details` table to obtain the `interest_name` as well as any details about the summary information
