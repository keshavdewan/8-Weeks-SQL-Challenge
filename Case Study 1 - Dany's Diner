# Case-Study-1-Danny's-Diner
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## Case Study Questions with Solutions

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
````sql
SELECT sales.customer_id,
      SUM(menu.price) AS total_amount
FROM sales
JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY total_amount DESC 
````
#### Solution:
| customer_id | total_amount |
| ----------- | -----------  |
| A           | 76           |
| B           | 74           |

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT customer_id,
      COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS visit_num
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY visit_num DESC
````

#### Solution:
| customer_id | visit_num  |
| ----------- | -----------|
| B           | 6          |

  		SELECT members.customer_id,
  				members.join_date,
  				sales.product_id,
  				menu.product_name,
  				ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                  PARTITION BY members.customer_id

**Rank All The Things**

**Danny also requires further information about the ```ranking``` of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ```ranking``` values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.**

```sql
WITH ranking_date AS (
                SELECT sales.customer_id,
                    sales.order_date,

                    menu.price,
                    CASE 
                        WHEN members.join_date > sales.order_date THEN 'N'
                            WHEN members.join_date <= sales.order_date THEN 'Y'

## Learnings
## 1. Use of DENSE_RANK(), RANK(), ROW_NUMBER()
      - DENSE_RANK(): Best when you want to show all tied top items for each customer without skipping ranks.
            Example - 
            | customer_id | product_name | order_count | rank |
            |-------------|--------------|-------------|------|
            | 1           | curry        | 5           | 1    |
            | 1           | sushi        | 5           | 1    |
            | 1           | ramen        | 5           | 1    |  <-- Rank 1 for all the items
      
      - RANK(): Similar to DENSE_RANK(), but skips ranks after ties.
            Example - 
            | customer_id | product_name | order_count | rank |
            |-------------|--------------|-------------|------|
            | 1           | curry        | 5           | 1    |
            | 1           | sushi        | 5           | 1    |
            | 1           | ramen        | 3           | 3    |  <-- Rank 2 is skipped due to the tie on rank 1
      
      - ROW_NUMBER(): Use when you need unique ranks without ties; not suitable for finding "most popular" items when ties exist.
            Example - 
            | customer_id | product_name | order_count | rank |
            |-------------|--------------|-------------|------|
            | 1           | curry        | 5           | 1    |
            | 1           | sushi        | 5           | 2    |  <-- No ties; each row gets a unique rank
            | 1           | ramen        | 3           | 3    |

## 2. Use of DATE_TRUNC and adding or removing months and end of months
	
 	DATE_TRUNC('month', '2021-01-31'::DATE) -- This trims the date to the first day of the month, so it becomes 2021-01-01
        + interval '1 month' -- Adding one month to 2021-01-01 gives 2021-02-01
        - interval '1 day' AS last_date	-- Subtracting one day from 2021-02-01 gives 2021-01-31, which is the last day of January.
