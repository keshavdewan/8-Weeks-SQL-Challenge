## Case Study Questions with Solutions

### A. High Level Sales Analysis

#### 1. What was the total quantity sold for all products?
_Approach Taken_
-  Used `SUM` of `qty` for calculating `total_quantity`
-  `JOIN` tables `product_details` and `sales`

````sql
SELECT pd.product_name,
	SUM(s.qty) AS total_quantity
FROM balanced_tree.product_details pd
JOIN balanced_tree.sales s ON pd.product_id = s.prod_id
GROUP BY pd.product_name
````

#### 2. What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?
_Approach Taken_
-	calculated product of `SUM` of `qty` and `price` from `sales` table

````sql
SELECT pd.product_name,
	SUM(s.qty * s.price) AS total_revenue
FROM balanced_tree.product_details pd
JOIN balanced_tree.sales s ON pd.product_id = s.prod_id
GROUP BY pd.product_name
````

#### 3. What was the total discount amount for all products?
_Approach Taken_
-	multi[plied `discuount` as well to the total revenue

````sql
SELECT pd.product_name,
	SUM(s.qty * s.price * s.discount/100) AS total_discount
FROM balanced_tree.product_details pd
JOIN balanced_tree.sales s ON pd.product_id = s.prod_id
GROUP BY pd.product_name
````

### B. Transaction Analysis

#### 1. How many unique transactions were there?
_Approach Taken_
-	used `COUNT(DISTINCT)`

````sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(txn_id)) AS unique_transaction
FROM balanced_tree.sales
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd69c094-db9e-4e64-a29d-b8552c9d6dce)

#### 2. What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction?
_Approach Taken_
-	CTE `TransactionProductCounts` counts the distinct transacation ids,
-	`COUNT(prod_id) OVER (PARTITION BY txn_id)` counts the number of products per transaction using a window function
-	Final `SELECT` statement calculates the average of product quantity

````sql
WITH TransactionProductCounts AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT txn_id, 
           COUNT(prod_id) OVER (PARTITION BY txn_id) AS product_txn_qty
    FROM balanced_tree.sales
)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(product_txn_qty)) AS avg_products_qty
FROM TransactionProductCounts
````

#### 3. What are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?
_Approach Taken_
-	CTE `transaction_revenue` calculates the `transaction_revenue` for each transaction
-	Final `SELECT` statement uses `PERCENTILE_CONT` to calculate 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of `transaction_revenue`

````sql
WITH transaction_revenue AS(
		SELECT txn_id,
			SUM(price * qty) AS transaction_revenues
		FROM balanced_tree.sales
		GROUP BY txn_id
)
SELECT 
	PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY transaction_revenues) AS percentile_25th,
	PERCENTILE_CONT(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY transaction_revenues) AS percentile_50th,
	PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY transaction_revenues) AS percentile_75th
FROM transaction_revenue
````

#### 4. What is the average discount value per transaction?
_Approach Taken_
-	CTE `totaldiscount` calculates the `total_discount` by calculating product of `SUM` of `qty`, `price` and `discount`
-	Fianl `SELECT` statement calculates the `AVG` of `total_discount`

````sql
WITH totaldiscount AS(
		SELECT txn_id,
			SUM(qty * price * discount/100) AS total_discount
		FROM balanced_tree.sales
		GROUP BY txn_id
)

SELECT  ROUND(AVG(total_discount),2) AS avg_discount
FROM totaldiscount
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8f9c436-fbe7-4a62-80f0-1fdf8a18ce07)

#### 5. What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?
_Approach Taken_
-	CTE `transactions_cte` counts the distinct `txn_id`
-	Final `SELECT` statement calculates the percentage of `txn_id` for members and non-members	

````sql
WITH transactions_cte AS (
  SELECT member,
    	COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) AS transactions
  FROM balanced_tree.sales
  GROUP BY member
)

SELECT member,
  	transactions,	
	  ROUND(100 * transactions
	    /(SELECT SUM(transactions) 
	FROM transactions_cte)) AS percentage
FROM transactions_cte
GROUP BY member, transactions
````

#### 6. What is the average revenue for member transactions and non-member transactions?
_Approach Taken_
-	CTE `transaction_cte` calculates the `total_revenue`
-	Final `SELECT` statement rounds the `avg` of the `total_revenue` to calculate the `avg_revenue`

````sql
WITH transactions_cte AS (
  SELECT member,
	 txn_id,
	SUM(qty * price) AS total_revenue
FROM balanced_tree.sales
GROUP BY member,
	txn_id
)
SELECT member,
	ROUND(AVG(total_revenue),2) AS avg_revenue
FROM transactions_cte
GROUP BY member
````

### C. Product Analysis

#### 1. What are the top 3 products by total revenue before discount?
_Approach Taken_
- 	calculate the `SUM` of `qty` *  `price`


````sql
SELECT pd.product_name,
	SUM(s.qty) * SUM(s.price) AS total_revenue
FROM balanced_tree.product_details pd
JOIN balanced_tree.sales s ON pd.product_id = s.prod_id
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 3
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e68ff20-2130-4788-bc4d-c277402b77ea)

#### 2. What is the total quantity, revenue and discount for each segment?	

````sql
SELECT segment_id,
	segment_name,
	SUM(s.qty) AS total_qty,
	SUM(s.price * s.qty) AS total_revenue,
	SUM((s.price * s.qty) * s.discount/100) AS total_discount
FROM balanced_tree.product_details pd
JOIN balanced_tree.sales s ON pd.product_id = s.prod_id
GROUP BY segment_id,
	segment_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f88a4af3-1081-4dc2-ba72-b57512fc4c5e)


#### 3. What is the top selling product for each segment?
_Approach Taken_
-	CTE `top_selling` calculates and `Ranks()` the `segment_id` w.r.t `qty`
-	Final `SELECT` statement `LIMIT` this ranking to 1

````sql
WITH top_selling AS(
		SELECT segment_id,
			segment_name,
			product_id,
			product_name,
			SUM(s.qty) AS total_qty,
			RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY segment_id 
					ORDER BY SUM(s.qty) DESC) AS ranking
		FROM balanced_tree.product_details pd
		JOIN balanced_tree.sales s ON pd.product_id = s.prod_id
		GROUP BY segment_id,
		segment_name,
		product_id,
		product_name
				
)
SELECT segment_id,
	segment_name,
	product_id,
	product_name,
	total_qty
FROM top_selling
WHERE ranking = 1
GROUP BY segment_id,
	segment_name,
	product_id,
	product_name,
	total_qty
````
